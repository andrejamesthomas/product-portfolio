# Product Management Portfolio

This repository contains a structured collection of artefacts, case studies, frameworks, and examples of product work that reflect practical Product Management and Product Ownership practices.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate structured thinking, decision-making rigor, and the ability to connect product discovery, delivery, and impact assessment in a consistent and transparent way.

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This repository was created to:
- Demonstrate the ability to break down complex product problems.
- Showcase discovery, experimentation, and impact evaluation practices.
- Provide examples of clear and structured product documentation.
- Highlight autonomy in defining frameworks, processes, and tools.
- Reinforce analytical and data-informed decision-making skills.
