# Case Study: Pivoting Product Direction After Invalidating a Core Assumption

## 1. Context
We initiated a product initiative aimed at addressing a perceived user problem that had been repeatedly raised through stakeholder feedback and high-level signals (e.g. feature requests, anecdotal feedback, roadmap inputs).

The initiative was positioned as a meaningful value driver and was included in the roadmap before in-depth discovery had been completed.

- Product / domain: Digital product feature aimed at improving user efficiency
- Target users: Existing active users within a specific workflow
- Environment: Mature product with an established user base
- Constraints: Fixed delivery window, limited discovery capacity upfront, roadmap commitments

## 2. Problem Statement
The initial problem statement assumed that users were experiencing friction in a specific part of their workflow and that introducing a new feature would significantly improve efficiency and satisfaction.

This assumption was treated as sufficiently validated based on indirect signals, and the initiative progressed into early solution exploration without explicit confirmation of the underlying user need.

## 3. Objectives

### Business Objectives
- Increase engagement with the targeted workflow.
- Strengthen the perceived value of the product in a competitive area.
- Deliver a visible improvement aligned with roadmap commitments.

### User Objectives
- Reduce perceived friction in the targeted workflow.
- Improve speed and clarity when completing key tasks.

## 4. Discovery and Assumptions
Discovery activities were initiated to validate the core assumptions before committing to full delivery.

Key assumptions:
- Users clearly recognised the targeted workflow as a problem area.
- The proposed feature addressed the primary source of friction.
- Users would adopt a new solution if it reduced theoretical effort.

Discovery activities included:
- Qualitative user interviews focused on recent workflow experiences.
- Review of behavioural data related to task completion and drop-off.
- Mapping the full user journey to identify actual pain points.\

## 5. Key Insight
Discovery invalidated the core assumption.

Users did not perceive the targeted workflow as a primary problem. While some friction existed, it was not a decisive factor in their overall experience. More importantly, users consistently highlighted a different, adjacent problem as significantly more painful and time-consuming.

In several interviews, users explicitly stated that they would not change their behaviour for the proposed solution, even if it were available.
