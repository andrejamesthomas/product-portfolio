# Product Documentation

This section contains examples of product documentation used to communicate intent, requirements, and decisions to engineering teams and stakeholders.

Typical artefacts include:
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Epics and feature decomposition
- Functional specifications
- Behavioural flows and diagrams
- Reusable templates

The focus is on clarity, consistency, and alignment rather than exhaustive technical detail.
