# Prototypes and Validations

This section contains lightweight prototypes, simulations, or validations used to test assumptions and business logic early.

Examples include:
- Simple scripts or simulations
- Business rule validation
- Logic-based or functional prototypes

These artefacts demonstrate fast feedback loops and pragmatic validation approaches.
